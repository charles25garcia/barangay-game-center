# Barangay Game Center

A React (Next.js) prototype for the Brgy Game Center player home experience with a local SQLite persistence route.

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Redux Toolkit for shared client state
- SQLite persistence through the Next.js `/api/state` route
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit/component tests

This is a separate, standalone project from `codes/react/online-fruit-game`. The fruit game is treated
as an integrated external game and is linked to, not embedded or merged into, this codebase.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:3100` by default (kept distinct from `online-fruit-game`, which runs on
`http://localhost:3000`). Run the fruit game separately with its own `npm run dev` if you want the "Play"
launch link to resolve.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the dev server on port 3100 using Webpack for native SQLite compatibility on Windows.
- `npm run build` – production build.
- `npm run test` – run unit and component tests once.
- `npm run test:watch` – run tests in watch mode.
- `npm run lint` – lint the project.

## Data and Persistence

- The SQL seed under `src/@code/database/seed.sql` initializes the SQLite database on first run, including the game catalog.
- Runtime state is stored in `src/@code/database/game-center.sqlite` in the `app_state` table.
- The browser hydrates through `GET /api/state`; Redux remains the UI state cache.
- `PUT /api/state` persists client changes and `DELETE /api/state` resets SQLite from the seed data.
- The database file is ignored by Git and must be backed up or migrated separately for deployment.

## PayMongo Sandbox

The wallet top-up demo is test-mode only. It accepts only a PayMongo `sk_test_` key, is disabled in production, and does not add coins from a browser redirect. Coins are credited only after a valid test-mode `checkout_session.payment.paid` webhook.

Configure these local environment variables in the development environment (never commit their values):

Start from `.env.example` and keep the actual values in an ignored local `.env.local` file.

```text
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
PAYMONGO_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
PAYMONGO_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPES=gcash
GAME_CENTER_BASE_URL=https://your-public-test-tunnel.example
```

`PAYMONGO_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPES` is optional and defaults to `gcash`. To offer additional methods, use a comma-separated list of methods enabled for the PayMongo account. This demo accepts `gcash`, `paymaya`, `grab_pay`, and `shopeepay`; PayMongo can still reject methods that are not enabled or supported for the account's Checkout flow.

Register a PayMongo **test-mode** webhook at `https://your-public-test-tunnel.example/api/payments/webhook` for `checkout_session.payment.paid`, and copy its endpoint secret to `PAYMONGO_TEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. PayMongo requires a publicly reachable endpoint for webhook delivery; a local HTTPS tunnel can be used for the demo. Restart Next.js after setting variables. Open `/wallet/top-up`, complete a test e-wallet authorization, and wait for the webhook-confirmed status. The seeded demo profile is the only credited player in this prototype.

While a purchase is pending, the status endpoint also checks its stored Checkout Session against PayMongo test mode. This recovers paid sessions if webhook delivery was missed; the browser return itself never grants coins.

The package IDs, PHP amounts, and coin quantities are server-owned in `src/@shared/utils/coinPackages.ts`; checkout accepts only the package ID and grants exactly 1 coin per ₱1. On first database initialization after this rule, a one-time migration corrects previous sandbox package grants with compensating ledger entries and syncs the seeded player's admin coin balance. This sandbox integration is not a production payment system and has no live-key support, real-money balance isolation, refunds, withdrawals, or cash-out.

## Architecture

```text
src/
  @shared/        # framework-agnostic reusable code (components, types, enums, utils, helpers, interfaces)
  @code/          # cross-cutting app infrastructure (state, routers, components)
  screens/        # page-level components and their page-relative subcomponents
  app/            # Next.js App Router route files (thin, delegate to screens/*)
  @code/database/ # SQLite adapter and SQL seed
```

`http` and `interceptors` folders under `@code` remain intentionally omitted in this prototype. The
SQLite state route is the current local persistence boundary; authentication and production authorization
are still not implemented.

**Naming deviation:** the workspace architecture instructions call this folder `pages`. In a Next.js App
Router project, a literal `pages/` (or `src/pages/`) directory is auto-detected by Next's Pages Router and
conflicts with `app/` routes of the same name (confirmed via a failed build in this project). This folder
is named `screens` instead, aliased as `@screens/*`, to keep the same "page components + page-relative
subcomponents" responsibility without triggering that collision.
